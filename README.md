# CureLink

CureLink is a Django based web application designed to aid people in finding the best doctors from nearby hospitals for booking check-ups and appointments with the best doctors. We employ the services of
geolocation APIs and advanced filtering and selection procedures for implementing the same. 

Further, keeping the user experience in mind, we have implemented a real-time user feedback and rating metric that is displayed by the application corresponding to each doctor, at the same time we provide users
with email reminders exactly 5 hours prior to their appointments. Doctors also have the ability to provide users with e-prescriptions directly within the platform, ensuring accuracy and eliminating the use of 
paper-based prescriptions.
